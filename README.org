* Introduction

  This repository contains automated tools for building various embedded images.
  Primarily buildroot based ones for use in long running sensor installations.

* Dependencies
** buildessential
** golang
** dropbear
** wireguard

* Warnings
  
  Note: The post-build script adds the user's public key to the authorized_keys files of the image!

* TODO
*** Improve networking. This means only starting wireguard after we have an
    external connection and also means to continue trying to bring networking up
    once we're running.

*** Start adc, uploader, renderer
*** Start resilience
